# AI project using Machine learning Algorithms


PROBING DATA SET ANALYSIS:
This data set is provided in github in the below link
https://github.com/gubertoli/ProbingDataset and also provided here in this repo as
separate files.

Data set preparation

This code works with three different data sets malicious_dataset.csv, attack_labels.csv,
normal_dataset.csv.These three files have been merged into a file named CSV3.csv

We need all three datasets to generate the CSV3 while working on colab make sure to
upload these 3 csv files before executing the program.

Code execution

The dataset has Hex data which needs to be converted into Int and Float for the ML
Algorithms to function well. This is the most time consuming task while execution as
it needs to check and convert 1.5 million values multiple times for every column.

Once the data set is prepared this code runs pretty fast analyzig the data and
getting us the results and visualizations. Step wise working and explanation of the
code is given in the report. Please refer to the section code implementation steps.
